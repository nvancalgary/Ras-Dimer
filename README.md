We provide two sets of pdb files of KRas dimer. 
All structures, which were final snapshots from 8-microsecond trajectories, were cooled down from 310 K to 0.1 K for 10 ps, and then have energy minimized.
Solvent accessible surface areas were computed for these structures.
1. PDB_2RAS contains structures of only KRas dimer, GTP and MG
Please check this out first

2. PDB_2RAS_all contains those KRas dimer structures with ions, water and lipids
These structures were re-centered and properly wrap into the unit cell.
We can provide Amber restart files and Prmtop upon request.
Please read README.md in PDB_2RAS for more information.
