We provide two sets of pdb files. All structures, which were snapshots at about 8 microsecond, 
were cooled down from 310 K to 0.1 K during 10 ps, and then have energy minimized.
Solvent accessible surface areas were computed for these structures.
1. structures of only KRas dimer, GTP and MG

2. structures of those KRas dimer with ions, water and lipids
