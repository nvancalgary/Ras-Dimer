We provide two sets of pdb files of KRas dimer. 
All structures, which were final snapshots from 8-microsecond trajectories, were cooled down from 310 K to 0.1 K for 10 ps, and then have energy minimized.
Solvent accessible surface areas were computed for these structures.
1. PDB_2RAS contains structures of only KRas dimer, GTP and MG

2. PDB_2RAS_all structures of those KRas dimer structures with ions, water and lipids
