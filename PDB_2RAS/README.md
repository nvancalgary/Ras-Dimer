In this depository, we provide two sets of KRas dimer structures from MD simulations
All of these structures were cooled down for 10 ps from 310 K to 0.1 K, and then minimized.

1. 4 special KRas dimer structures: Elevated KRas (Fig. 2f), alpha4-alpha5 interface (Fig. 4d), 
and the interfaces with R68 and R149 fingers. 

2-3. 25 selected KRas dimer structures selected for interfaces that are stable for more than 80% 
of simulation time, then ranked based on Solvent accessible surface areas (SASA), see Fig. S7.

4. Sorting 25 structures of KRas dimer.ipynb helps to sort the 25 structures with "weird" filenames.

5. load_selected_structures.vmd is also provided to have color-coded segments for the KRas dimer

6. PNG files generated from those 25 structures with the *vmd file
